** Customize Ubuntu Mate

Get list of keybinding schemas:
#+begin_src
gsettings list-schemas
#+end_src

In the schema org.mate.Marco.global-keybindings set the key _run-command-6_, because it is Win+S by default:

#+begin_src
gsettings set org.mate.Marco.global-keybindings run-command-6 ''
#+end_src

Do this for all keybindings you want to re-use
